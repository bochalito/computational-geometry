# 3D Convec Hull, Curvature of 2D and 3D Models
Project developed for university. The aim of this project is to write my own algorithms used in Computational Geometry.
In the source code you can find algorithms that calculate 2D curvature, mean and gaussian curvature of 3D models and convex hull of 
a 3D model. 

## Getting started
How to setup the project:
### Prerequisites
You need to install Visual Studio C++ Express 2010. Then open the project with any version of Visual Studio you like. Make sure that on project 
properties you will select:

```
Platform Toolset: Visual Studio 2010
```

You can then run the project and follow the on screen instructions. For any info contact me. I would be happy to help you.
